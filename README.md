A simple web application designed for easy access
to apps, clever and helpful widgets and more. It's
a hub to collaborate that just works.

## What is RC2?

RC2 is a collaborative hub designed for use in
workplaces, schools and other places of work. It's built
off the concept and ideas from C2K and R2K, while being
entirely rebuilt from the ground up. RC2 includes features
like:

- Live features such as a built in Clock and Date tracker
- Functional, responsive UI
- A page for quick launches of commonly used apps
- Easy to use customisation features
- Support for ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

Oh, and it's totally free.

## FAQ

### Why do I get an error saying "You can't run RC2 locally."?

This happens because you're trying to launch the raw HTML files without
running them through a LocalServer or Online. Because of the new
experimental features RC2 introduces, local HTML files entirely break
these features. With some editing, you CAN in theory remove this
restriction, but we don't recommend it.

### Are more updates planned in future?

Yes.
