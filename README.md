## What is RC2?

RC2 is a collaborative hub designed for use in
workplaces, schools and other places of work. It's built
off the concept and ideas from C2K and R2K, while being
entirely rebuilt from the ground up. RC2 includes features
like:

- Live features such as a built in Clock
- Up to 24 apps, allowing you to get things done faster
- Recreated widgets from C2K, cleaned up
- User-friendly customisation options

## FAQ

### Why do I get an error saying "You can't run RC2 locally."?

This happens because you're trying to launch the raw HTML files without
running them through a LocalServer or Online. Because of the new
experimental features RC2 introduces, local HTML files entirely break
these features. With some editing, you CAN in theory remove this
restriction, but we don't recommend it.

### Why Release Build 2? What happened to sidebar?

Release Build 1 was an attempt to recreate what made R2K great. While we
were initially proud of it, the issues became apparent; many small
design flaws and incomplete coding made the experience worse.
With Release Build 2, many of these issues are fixed. Sidebar
was removed because it didn't fit into the true, complete
vision of RC2; it interfered with things too deeply.
RC2 will continue to be improved overtime, and I hope to someday
truly finish it.

### Are more updates planned in future?

Yes.
